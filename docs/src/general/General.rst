Development Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project is is based upon the ska-react-webapp-skeleton, which is intended as a basis for all React applications

The skeleton includes tools for linting, code formatting, and testing which are easily integrated into various IDEs.
It also includes modular federation, exposing the ReactSkeleton component, which can be imported into other applications.
The documentation of the skeleton provides an overview for all the standard aspects mentioned here and so can be referenced
as required for these items

Note that it also includes authentication components, providing a number of differing options.  If Authentication is Not
required by the application, then the ska-login-page library, and all components that it provides, can be removed from the 
application, as well as ensuring that the skao:update script is amended
