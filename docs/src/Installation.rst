### Steps to convert to your own application.

Here are the steps required to migrate this application for use within the Portal. These are required so that we can ensure a unique reference into the Portal. For this example we will use the name NewApp as the name of the new application

1. Clone the application into the appropriate folder
2. Follow the installation instructions in the previous paragraph
3. ReactSkeleton.tsx : Change `ReactSkeleton` to `NewApp` in 2 locations
4. ReactSkeleton.tsx : Change filename to `NewApp.tsx
5. ReactSkeleton.cy.tsx : Change `ReactSkeleton` to `NewApp` in 4 locations
6. ReactSkeleton.cy.tsx : Change filename to `NewApp.cy.tsx
7. Change Folder name from ReactSkeleton to NewApp
8. App.tsx : Change `ReactSkeleton` to `NewApp` in 4 locations
9. webPack.config.js : Change path for `ReactSkeleton` so it points to `NewApp\NewApp`.

Compilation and running this application will allow it to be shown within the ReactSkeleton menu item within the developer section of the SKA-Portal. Whilst initial development is being done and until the application is allocated a permanent location, it is suggested that no other WebPack changes are done.
